**Comparison of Regression Results Across Statistical Software and Countries**

The comparative analysis presented in the table validates the findings of the original study by replicating its regression models for job satisfaction across the USA, Japan, and Germany. The replication, conducted using both JASP and Python, shows a high degree of consistency in the results, confirming that the findings are robust and not dependent on the statistical software used.

Across all three countries, the model's predictive power varies, with Japan exhibiting the highest R-squared value (≈0.51), followed by the USA (≈0.44) and Germany (≈0.38). Despite these differences in overall model fit, certain predictors remain consistently significant. Specifically, having an "interesting job" and maintaining a "good relationship with management" emerge as the most influential factors for job satisfaction in all nations analyzed.

**Appendix B**

**Python Results**

To illustrate that the results described in the thought experiment are robust for different environments, we report the results obtained by replicating the analysis of the research using Phyton. The two graphs below, showing the relationships between in-sample metrics (R-squared and in-sample RMSE) and the out-of-sample RMSE, confirm the absence of a fixed relationship between a model’s explanatory power and its ability to predict unseen data, consistent with the results obtained using R.

Moreover, the red regression lines highlight that models that fit the training data very well can still perform poorly when predicting unseen observations, which is a typical indication of overfitting. 

The density plot of RMSE values for models with similar explanatory power still shows that, despite having similar R², their out-of-sample predictive performance varies considerably, once again confirming the results obtained with R. 

By replicating in Python the second analysis evaluating how well country-specific models predict data from other countries, we obtained results consistent with those from R. While the specific behaviour of each model, such as Japan's strong in-sample fit and weak out-of-sample performance, or Germany's low in-sample fit, was already discussed in the previous chapter, the Python replication confirms the same cross-country patterns. As shown in the bar chart and heat map below, these results support the idea that models trained in one national context do not automatically transfer well in terms of predictive accuracy when applied to other contexts.

| Model         | USA   | JAPAN | GERMANY |
|---------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Model USA     | N/A   | 1.351 | 0.886   |
| Model JAPAN   | 1.183 | N/A   | 1.193   |
| Model GERMANY | 0.812 | 1.317 | N/A     |

: Cross-country model performance showing RMSE values when models trained on one country are applied to predict data from other countries.

We conclude that the findings observed in R are fully replicated in Python. The patterns remain consistent, and the results support the same core thesis of our analysis.

# **Use of AI Tools** 

In our research process, we utilized several AI tools to support different aspects of our work: 

**GitHub Copilot**: Assisted us with coding tasks in both R and Python by providing intelligent code suggestions and automating repetitive coding patterns. 

**ChatGPT**: Helped us refine text into more academically appropriate language. 

**Claude 4.0 and Gemini 2.5**: These models were primarily used to restructure and improve the logical flow of our document, ensuring coherence and readability throughout.
